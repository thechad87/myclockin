The problem domain that I have chosen to problem solve would with regards to signing in and using you’re mobile device as you clocking in system instead of using a tag. The tag is an outdated system that needed to be upgraded and the best means to replace the tag would be with the device that everyone carries around with them on a daily bases, the device I’m referring to would be the mobile device. 

Many people either have turnstiles or a clocking tag to enter their place of work and most of the time there could be a number of tag’s being used for many different access point in a building, well the best solution would be to create QR code type solution could allow for access. This would also act another form as security as the device needs to unlocked in order for any unauthorized person to be allowed to scan the persons device, whereas with a tag anyone could switch or remove another person’s tag and use it in a malicious way.  

Another means that the clocking in application could be used for would be as a actual clock in and out system for staff that work shifts during the day, and this functionality could be added easily.
